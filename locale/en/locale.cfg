rebalance-t3-quality=Rebalance T3 Quality Module

[mod-setting-description]
rebalance-t3-quality=Increase the quality bonus of the T3 quality module from 2.5% to 4% (6.25% to 10% for legendary), so that its increase over T3 is more than the increase of T2 over T1, not substantially less. This results in a series of 1/2/4, more in line with the curve other modules follow.
